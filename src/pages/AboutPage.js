                <h1>My Story.</h1>
                <p> Where do I even start… It was a chilly Seattle evening in 1997. No, that’s too far back, But not by much.
                    <br></br><br></br>
                    While Late Night Woodworking was established in December of 2023, the long winding story of how it came 
                    about begins long before then. I think all the way back to elementary school, when I made my first creation, 
                    a catapult. I built this with my father, and although I don’t remember how much I actually helped, I do 
                    remember being really proud of it. I think that feeling even to this day has always driven me to continue 
                    to make things. All through out grade school I have these memories of projects that I worked on. In middle 
                    school, I made a Gatorade commercial and a slideshow music video to Superstar by Lupe Fiasco. In high 
                    school I drew a lot more and I started taking woodshop. I made the classic cutting board in woods 1, 
                    in woods 2 I made a sword, and in woods 3 I made an electric guitar! When I look back, it’s so obvious 
                    how much I enjoyed doing these things, but I think in the moment, I was just going through the motions. 
                    I was just your typical teenager playing too many sports and not doing enough homework. 
                    <br></br><br></br>
                    When it came time to apply to college, I was lost. I knew I wouldn’t be able to get into any “good” schools, 
                    so the only school I applied to was Eastern Washington University. In the fall of 2015, I was an Eagle! I 
                    remember when I first started college, I had the intention of getting a degree in economics. Then I met 
                    someone at a thanksgiving dinner, and this person asked me what I was getting a degree in economics for? 
                    I said I didn’t really know, it was one of the things in school I was okay at. He told me to look into 
                    computer science, I could get a job making a lot of money and work on the beach whenever I wanted. I 
                    thought that sounded pretty nice, being a young malleable man, I switched my major the day I got back 
                    to school. It turned out to be one of the best decisions I’ve made, computer science suited me so well. 
                    It checked all my boxes, it was challenging, I was making something, and it was full of problem solving. 
                    I wouldn’t trade the knowledge I gained, the experiences I had, and the people I met for anything.
                    <br></br><br></br>
                    In 4 years, I graduated EWU with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. Got a job right out of college 
                    working for NOAA developing applications, and I really could have worked from the beach if I wanted to. 
                    Shortly after starting my new job, COVID happened, and I was working from home. My desk was a plastic 
                    folding table and I hated it. I started searching for a nice desk online and soon realized I wasn’t going 
                    to find one I could afford, so I decided to build one. I already had attained the skills I needed from 
                    woodshop classes in high school, and luckily, my brother-in-law was already into woodworking and had all 
                    the necessary tools for such a build. This was the first piece of furniture I ever made. Little did I know 
                    what I really started with that build. I was working there for almost 2 ½ years, then due to some restrictions 
                    with COVID, I got fired. 
                    <br></br><br></br>
                    Being 25 with no job and a decent amount of money saved up wasn’t too bad. I took a little bit of time to 
                    myself, then I started grinding. I was studying every day, preparing for interviews that I was bound to get. 
                    But time went by, and nobody would interview me. It was a frustrating thing; I was in an industry where they 
                    claim a ton of jobs go unfulfilled every year, and here I am not able to get an interview. Then finally I got 
                    an interview with Pinterest, I made it through all the rounds and waited for their final decision. When it 
                    came, it hit me hard. After 8 months of hard work preparing myself to show a company that I’m worth it, I 
                    was rejected. I knew in my bones that I was a valuable asset, how could they not see it? I decided then and 
                    there, if I really wanted to be “successful”, I was going to have to do it on my own. I couldn’t wait for 
                    others to catch up.
                    <br></br><br></br>
                    At this point I had already started making YouTube videos, but the videos weren’t about woodworking. My first 
                    two videos were wakeboarding videos. Making those videos awakened something in me, I had this digital canvas, 
                    and I could paint anything. So, when I realized that I was going down my own path, I knew YouTube was the way.
                    That’s when 206 Golf was born, I was so dedicated to it that I burned through my savings, moved back into my
                     parents, somehow found myself with more debt than I accrued in college (thanks to Washington’s ESD), but 
                     I was committed. What can I say? I was/am a young man with nothing to lose. Nothing was going to stop me 
                     from achieving what I thought was my dream, until everything changed. Throughout the year and a half of 
                     making golf videos, I was woodworking, trying to make some money on the side. I got into watching other 
                     YouTubers make woodworking videos and I wanted to give it a shot, just for fun. I posted my first video, 
                     making a chessboard. I received a text from one of my best friends who hated my golf videos, he said “I 
                     want more.” So, I quickly made my second video, the Elmwood Foyer Table. On Christmas day, that video got 
                     around 20k views and was still going up. I really couldn’t have asked for a better gift. In all the time 
                     making the golf videos, I only got up to around 500 subs. From this one woodworking video, I got 1,500 subs. 
                     I dropped everything. Since Christmas day in 2023, I’ve been putting all my time and energy into Late Night 
                     Woodworking and 7 months in (today), I’m at just over 5,000 subs.

                    So, my dear reader, you may be wondering why I have told you all of this on the about page of a woodworking website. 
                    Well, this… is my story. Not finished joe.
