            <p>
                Where creativity meets the quiet hours. I have always found that I have this 
                burst of creativity super late at night, with whatever I am doing. <br></br>
                <br></br>
                It May be editing a video, doing the actual woodworking, photography, drawing, 
                or even coding... as I'm currently doing and it's midnight. 
                <br></br>
                Late Night Woodworking came along in 2023, and it's here to stay.

                <br></br>
                I'll add some more stuff on here when I get the time, I'm writing the code myself. 
                For now I just need it to get the job done, I'm sorry for all the bugs it still has.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                For now, this will have to do. If you have any questions or inquiries, 
                email me at <b>contact@latenightwoodworking.com</b>
                <br></br>
                or go to my instagram and DM on there.
